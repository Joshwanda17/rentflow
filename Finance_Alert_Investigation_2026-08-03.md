# WELILE FINANCE ALERT [CRITICAL] — Read-Only Architectural Investigation

Date: 2026-08-03 · Scope: read-only. No data, cron, trigger, threshold or alert change was made.

## 1. Alert Architecture

| Layer | Component | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | pg_cron job every 15 min (:00/:15/:30/:45) invoking the edge function with trigger_source='cron'; also 'publish' and 'manual' | finance_anomaly_scans rows land at exact quarter-hour boundaries, all trigger_source='cron'; header comment index.ts:8-11 |
| Detection | public.detect_finance_anomalies(p_min_amount) — 9 hard-coded checks | pg_proc.prosrc |
| Result persistence | public.run_finance_anomaly_scan(p_trigger_source) inserts one row per run into finance_anomaly_scans | pg_proc.prosrc |
| Severity/aggregation | inside detect_finance_anomalies (v_severity ladder) | see section 3 |
| Notification | supabase/functions/finance-anomaly-scan/index.ts | lines 198-293 |
| Recipients | finance_anomaly_alert_config id=1 allow-list only, no role fallback | index.ts:185-231 |
| Email | enqueue_email('transactional_emails') -> process-email-queue, from "Welile Reports <info@welile.com>" | index.ts:248-277 |
| SMS | sendSMS() multi-provider | index.ts:279-293 |

Live config: enabled=true, min_amount=1000, notify_emails={joshwanda17@gmail.com}, notify_phones={+256704825473} — matches the pinned constraint in mem/constraints/finance-anomaly-alert-recipients.md. Recipient selection is correct and is NOT a defect.

## 2. Execution Flow

```
pg_cron (15 min)
  -> edge fn finance-anomaly-scan
    -> config gate (enabled?)                    index.ts:185-196
    -> rpc run_finance_anomaly_scan('cron')      index.ts:198
        -> detect_finance_anomalies(NULL)  (9 checks)
        -> INSERT finance_anomaly_scans    (audit row, new scan_id each run)
    -> if anomaly_count == 0 and !force -> EXIT  index.ts:212-223   <-- ONLY suppression path
    -> build HTML report + SMS summary           index.ts:113-164
    -> queue email to allow-list                 index.ts:248-277
    -> send SMS to allow-list                    index.ts:279-293
    -> stamp scan row notified=true              index.ts:298-311
    -> emit system_event finance_anomaly_scan_completed
```

SMS template (index.ts:161-163):
`WELILE FINANCE ALERT [{SEVERITY}]: {n} wallet/ledger anomalies, exposure UGX {x}. {top 3 checks}. Full report emailed.`

## 3. Severity Classification Rules

Severity is NOT money-weighted, NOT persistence-weighted, NOT percentage-weighted. It is a max-of-category ladder triggered by a SINGLE non-zero row in any category.

| # | Check key | Condition | Window | Severity when count>0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | wallet_cache_vs_ledger | wallets vs v_user_wallet_strict, any bucket delta >= min_amount | all time | critical |
| 2 | negative_wallet_buckets | any bucket < 0 | all time | critical |
| 3 | pivot_drift | wallet_pivot_drift_view delta >= min_amount | all time | high |
| 4 | unbalanced_ledger_groups | cash_in <> cash_out per transaction_group_id | 24 h | critical |
| 5 | orphan_wallet_legs | ledger_scope='wallet' AND user_id IS NULL | all time (no window) | critical |
| 6 | routing_violations | wallet_routing_violations | 24 h | high |
| 7 | unrouted_movements | wallet_unrouted_movements | 24 h | high |
| 8 | overdraw_events | wallet_overdraw_events | 24 h | medium |
| 9 | wallet_legs_missing_bucket | wallet legs with wallet_bucket IS NULL | 24 h | medium |

Escalation: critical > high > medium. anomaly_count is the SUM of rows across all checks; total_exposure the SUM of absolute amounts across all checks. A large comparator artifact therefore inflates the headline of an alert whose severity was set by a different, tiny category. That is exactly what is happening.

## 4. Current Alert Inventory (latest scan 2026-08-03 04:15 UTC)

Headline: critical, 475 anomalies, exposure UGX 44,692,158.

| Check | Count | Amount (UGX) | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| wallet_cache_vs_ledger | 2 | 51,228 | critical |
| negative_wallet_buckets | 0 | — | clean |
| pivot_drift | 435 | 44,065,730 | high |
| unbalanced_ledger_groups | 0 | — | clean |
| orphan_wallet_legs | 8 | 575,200 | critical |
| routing_violations | 0 | — | clean |
| unrouted_movements | 0 | — | clean |
| overdraw_events | 0 | — | clean |
| wallet_legs_missing_bucket | 30 | 161,654 | medium |

98.6% of reported exposure comes from one category (pivot_drift) that is a comparator defect.

## 5. Read-Only Recomputation and False-Positive Analysis

| Alert | Reported | Recomputed now | Actual risk | Financial impact | Classification | SMS-worthy? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pivot_drift | 435 / 44,065,730 | 435 / 44,065,730 | None | UGX 0 | Comparator defect (false positive) | No |
| wallet_cache_vs_ledger | 2 / 51,228 | 3 / ~57,468 | Low, real | <= UGX 57,468 | True positive, immaterial | Email/dashboard |
| orphan_wallet_legs | 8 / 575,200 | 8, all dated 2026-07-22..26 | Data-quality only | UGX 0 movement | Frozen historical artifact | No |
| wallet_legs_missing_bucket | 30 / 161,654 | 30 (27 system_balance_correction, 3 agent_commission_earned) | Labelling only | UGX 0 | Mostly expected behaviour | No |
| negative buckets / unbalanced groups / routing / unrouted / overdraw | 0 | 0 | — | — | Clean | n/a |

### Proof that pivot_drift is a comparator defect

wallet_pivot_drift_view computes the cache side as:

```sql
COALESCE((v.j ->> 'withdrawable_raw')::numeric, 0)   -- also 'float_raw', 'advance_raw'
FROM wallets_physical wp
LEFT JOIN LATERAL get_user_wallet_view(wp.user_id) v(j) ON true
```

get_user_wallet_view() actually returns:

```json
{"user_id":"...","withdrawable":7000000,"float_balance":7000000,
 "advance_balance":0,"pending_holds":0,"total_visible":14000000,"restricted_held":0}
```

There is NO withdrawable_raw / float_raw / advance_raw key. Every ->> returns NULL, COALESCE(...,0) makes the "cache" side hard-zero for every user, so drift = 0 - pivot_balance, i.e. the view reports each funded user's entire balance as drift.

Confirmation over the 435 flagged users:

| Comparison | Mismatching users |
|---|---|
| pivot vs v_user_wallet_strict (ledger truth) | 1 of 435 |
| the view's "cache" column vs v_user_wallet_strict | 416 of 435 |

Example user 2ef293fd-...: wallets.withdrawable_balance = 7,000,000; v_user_wallet_strict.withdrawable = 7,000,000; ledger_balance_pivot = 7,000,000; the view reports cache_withdrawable = 0 and withdrawable_drift = -7,000,000.

The pivot table itself is healthy: 55,930 of 55,998 wallets have pivot rows, 0 flagged users have an empty pivot, and the pivot agrees with the strict ledger. The earlier "pivot never populated" hypothesis is disproven — the defect now sits in the view's cache-side key names.

## 6. Root Cause Analysis

1. Primary (98.6% of exposure): key-name mismatch in wallet_pivot_drift_view (*_raw vs actual keys). Every funded wallet is permanently "drifting". Monitoring defect, zero financial impact.
2. Secondary (why severity says CRITICAL): orphan_wallet_legs — 8 legs dated 22-26 July (agent_float_deposit, system_balance_correction) — is the only all-time-window CRITICAL check with a non-zero count and can never self-clear because ledger rows are immutable. Together with the 2-3 genuine small cache drifts it pins severity at critical permanently.
3. Why the identical SMS every 15 minutes: the notifier has no dedup, no state comparison, no acknowledgement check and no cool-down. index.ts:212-223 is the only suppression path and fires only when anomaly_count === 0. Every run mints a new scan_id, so the SMS idempotency key (finance-anomaly:{scan_id}:{phone}, index.ts:287) is unique per run and cannot dedup. Result: 48 scans in 17 h, all critical, all anomaly_count=475, all total_exposure=44,692,158, all notified=true. The scan is NOT reading stale data — it recomputes fully each run; the inputs genuinely never change.
4. Contributing: anomaly_count and total_exposure mix categories, so a comparator artifact dominates the headline figure executives see.

## 7. Financial Risk Assessment

| Area | Affected? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| User balances | No | wallets agrees with v_user_wallet_strict for 55,995 of 55,998 wallets |
| Withdrawals | No | gate uses get_user_available_balance (strict); untouched by the pivot view |
| Deposits | No | no unbalanced groups, routing violations or unrouted movements in 24 h |
| Ledger integrity | No | 0 unbalanced groups in 24 h; the 8 orphan legs are owner-label gaps, not value gaps |
| Financial reporting | Marginal | the 8 orphan wallet legs (UGX 575,200) are unattributed per user |
| Executive dashboards | Yes, adversely | headline exposure overstated by ~44.07 M (44.7 M reported vs ~0.06 M real) |
| Monitoring only | Yes | this is where the real defect lives |

Genuine financial exposure today: approximately UGX 57,468 across 3 wallets (Sharif Kc +1,228; JOSHUA WANDA -50,000; Muyomba Peter +6,240) = 0.13% of the reported figure. Executives are being paged about monitoring inconsistencies, not financial incidents.

## 8. Monitoring Risk Assessment

- Alert fatigue: 96 identical CRITICAL SMS per day to a single owner; a real incident would be indistinguishable from the noise.
- The comparator fails silently: a view referencing non-existent JSON keys degrades to 0 instead of erroring.
- No materiality floor: a 1,228 UGX cache delta yields the same CRITICAL as a 10 M breach.
- Checks 1 and 5 have no time window, so historical rows escalate forever.
- finance_anomaly_scans has no retention or rollup; it grows unbounded (48 rows in 17 h).

## 9. Recommended Alert Hierarchy (recommendation only — nothing implemented)

| Category | Recommended channel | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| unbalanced_ledger_groups (24 h) | SMS immediately | true double-entry breach |
| negative_wallet_buckets | SMS immediately | real user-visible money defect |
| wallet_cache_vs_ledger | SMS only above a materiality floor (e.g. >= 100 K single user or >= 1 M aggregate); email below | today's 57 K is not a paging event |
| routing_violations, unrouted_movements (24 h) | Email | triage, not paging |
| overdraw_events (24 h) | Email | the clamp is protective behaviour |
| orphan_wallet_legs | Dashboard only; add a time window or an acknowledged-exclusion list | immutable historical rows can never self-clear |
| wallet_legs_missing_bucket | Dashboard only; exclude system_balance_correction | labelling, no value impact |
| pivot_drift | Never escalate until the view is fixed | 100% monitoring artifact today |

Cross-cutting recommendations:
1. Fix wallet_pivot_drift_view key names (withdrawable / float_balance / advance_balance) before trusting any pivot number.
2. Require persistence (same finding in >= 2 consecutive scans) before escalating anything below critical.
3. Add state-change dedup: notify only when the fingerprint of (per-check counts + severity) changes, plus an optional low-frequency heartbeat.
4. Add auto-close semantics and an acknowledgement store so an acknowledged historical artifact stops paging.
5. Report total_exposure per category, never as one mixed sum.
6. Add retention/rollup to finance_anomaly_scans.
