// Ownership guard for personal money notifications (deposits, withdrawals,
// payout receipts, float credits).
//
// WHY: `profiles.email` is not unique. Agents frequently register tenants,
// landlords and sub-accounts using their OWN gmail address, so one mailbox can
// be attached to many user rows. Sending a receipt to `profiles.email` blindly
// means that one person receives every other account's deposit/withdrawal
// email — mass spam, and a privacy leak of other people's balances.
//
// This helper resolves the address that provably belongs to the user:
//   1. their real auth login email (unique per account), else
//   2. their profile email ONLY when no other profile/auth account uses it,
//   3. otherwise null -> do not email (SMS/in-app still notify the user).
