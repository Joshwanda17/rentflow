/**
 * Single source of truth for "is this withdrawal actionable in the Merchant
 * Agent payout queue?".
 *
 * Mirrors the database view `public.v_merchant_payout_queue` exactly:
 *
 *   status IN (queue statuses)
 *   AND processed_at IS NULL
 *   AND fin_ops_reference IS NULL
 *
 * The database is the enforcing authority (the view plus the
 * `trg_enforce_settled_withdrawal_terminal` trigger, which refuses to move a
 * settled/evidence-carrying payout back into any queue state). This module
 * exists so every client read, badge count, realtime handler and render filter
 * uses the identical predicate instead of re-deriving it — a paid payout can
 * therefore never be re-inserted into the queue by a stale cache, an optimistic
 * update, a retry, or a duplicate confirmation.
