    q: "What is Welile?",
    a: "Welile is a Ugandan platform that helps tenants access rent through a flexible Rent Plan, backed by community Supporters and served on the ground by field agents. All amounts are in Ugandan Shillings (UGX).",
    tags: ["about", "what", "welile", "overview"],
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get rent help as a tenant?",
    a: "Create a free account, complete verification (your national ID and residence), and an agent or landlord connects you to a Rent Plan. You then repay in small, regular amounts that fit your income.",
    tags: ["tenant", "rent", "help", "how", "repay"],
  },
  {
    q: "How do agents earn on Welile?",
    a: "Agents register tenants, list houses, and collect rent in the field. They earn commission on the collections and placements they make, tracked in a wallet they can withdraw from.",
    tags: ["agent", "earn", "commission", "work", "job"],
  },
  {
    q: "How can I support tenants and earn Returns?",
    a: "Become a Supporter: your funds help tenants access rent, and you earn periodic Returns. Rates and terms are shown in the app when you sign up. (Terminology: Supporter, not lender; Returns, not interest.)",
    tags: ["supporter", "invest", "fund", "returns", "earn"],
  },
  {
    q: "How does a landlord benefit?",
    a: "Landlords list their houses and receive guaranteed, on-time rent instead of chasing tenants each month. Welile handles collection through its agent network.",
    tags: ["landlord", "house", "rent", "guarantee"],
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Welile Trust Score / AI ID?",
    a: "Every user builds a Welile Trust Score — a reliability identity based on real behaviour like on-time payments and verification. A higher score unlocks better access over time.",
    tags: ["trust", "score", "ai id", "identity", "reliability"],
  },
  {
    q: "Is Welile free to join?",
    a: "Yes, creating an account is free. You only ever deal in UGX, and you can start as a tenant, agent, landlord, or Supporter.",
    tags: ["free", "cost", "join", "signup", "price"],
  },
  {
    q: "How do I check what I personally qualify for?",
    a: "Personal figures — your rent access, wallet balance, commissions, or Returns — are shown once you create a free account and sign in. Ask 'check my rent access' or 'see agent commissions' to get started, and I'll share the right signup link.",
    tags: ["check", "qualify", "balance", "personal", "account", "my"],
  },
  {
    q: "Is my money safe and what currency is used?",
    a: "Welile operates strictly in Ugandan Shillings (UGX). Every balance, Rent Plan, commission, and Return is recorded in UGX, and your account activity is tied to your verified identity.",
    tags: ["safe", "security", "currency", "ugx", "money"],
