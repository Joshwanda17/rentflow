/**
 * Returns the user's TRUE withdrawable balance using the strict
 * ledger-only `get_user_wallet_view` RPC. End-user wallet UIs MUST NOT
 * read `wallets.balance` / `wallets.withdrawable_balance` directly —
 * those are operator-only caches that can drift above the ledger.
 *
 * The returned `withdrawableCached` field is kept for API compatibility
 * with existing callers but now mirrors `available` exactly (no drift
 * possible). `ledgerNet` reflects the raw ledger net used internally.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (2026-08-15): a failed read THROWS. It must never resolve to
 * `available: 0` — that turned every transient RPC failure into a bogus
 * "Insufficient funds. Available: UGX 0" while the wallet card (same RPC,
 * cached) still showed the real balance. "Unknown" and "zero" are
 * different states and callers must treat them differently.
